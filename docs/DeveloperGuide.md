### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nurseybook/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nurseybook/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteElderly 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nurseybook/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ElderlyListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nurseybook/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Elderly` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nurseybook/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `NurseyBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an elderly).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deleteElderly 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteElderly 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `NurseyBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `NurseyBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nurseybook/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="400" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the nursey book data i.e., all `Elderly` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueElderlyList` object) and all `Task` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTaskList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Elderly` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Elderly>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Task` objects in a similar way to `Elderly` objects which is also exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>`.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores the states of the nursey book after the execution of commands that change the data in `NurseyBookState` objects.
* depends on some classes in the `Logic` component because the `Model` component saves the result after the execution of commands that change the data of nursey book.
* does not depend on the `Storage` and `Ui` components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, it should make sense on its own without depending on `Storage` and `Ui`)


<img src="images/DetailedModelClassDiagram.png" width="800" /> 

More details regarding `Person`, `Elderly`, `Nok`(Next of kin) and `Task` objects.

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nurseybook/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both NurseyBook data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `NurseyBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `nurseybook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Filter command

#### Implementation
The implementation of the filter command is facilitated by the FilterCommand class and ElderlyHasTagPredicate class.
ElderlyHasTagPredicate contains a set of tags that was queried in the filter command and has a method `test`
to test whether an Elderly has all the tags in the set.

Given below is the class diagram of the FilterCommand and the ElderlyHasTagPredicate.

![](images/FilterClassDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter command works:

![FilterSequenceDiagram](images/FilterSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FilterCommand` and `ElderlyHasTagPredicate` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

As tags can only be alphanumeric, the `parse` method in FilterCommandParser checks that the all the tags queried are valid first before creating the FilterCommand and ElderlyHasTagPredicate objects.
If there is a tag that is invalid, an exception will be thrown.

When executing the filter command, the `updateFilteredElderlyList` method of Model calls other methods that are omitted from the diagram.
One of the methods then calls the `test` method of the ElderlyHasTagPredicate object with every Elderly saved in nursey book. The checking for the presence of tags is case-insensitive. 
The list of Elderly that return true for `test` is then assigned to `filteredElderlies` in ModelManager and displayed in the GUI.

#### Design Considerations
**Aspect: How to store tags:** 
* **Alternative 1:** Create a new class TagSet to store tags
    * Pros: Can add custom methods
    * Cons: More code needs to be written and more room for bugs
* **Alternative 2:** Use Java Util Set to store tags
    * Pros: Easy to import and use
    * Cons: Methods that can be used are limited to the methods in Set

**Decision:** Alternative 2 was chosen as the tags are simply kept as a collection.
Only the simple operations such as checking whether a Tag is in the Set and changing the Tags in the set are needed.
Thus, the methods provided in Java Util Set are sufficient and there is no need to implement custom methods.

### Mark a task as done feature

#### How task status is changed
`Task` now contains `Status`, which stores the completion status of the task. `Task` now implements the following operations:

* `Task#markAsDone()`â€‰â€”â€‰Sets the task status as done

`TaskList` uses the method above to mark the specified task as done in `TaskList#markTaskAsDone(Task toMark)`. This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#markTaskAsDone(Task target)`.

#### How the target task is identified
First, the `DoneTaskCommandParser` parses the `Index` which is passed to the `DoneTaskCommand`.  The `Index` identifies the task to be marked as done.

The following sequence diagram shows how this operation works:

![DoneTaskSequenceDiagram](images/DoneTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters the command for this feature:

![DoneTaskActivityDiagram](images/DoneTaskActivityDiagram.png)

### Add Recurring Task feature

#### Implementation
Task now contains `Recurrence`,  which encapsulates the recurrence type of the task. There are 4 recurrence types:
1. `NONE` -> Non-recurring `Task`
2. `DAY` -> Recurring `Task` that repeats daily
3. `WEEKLY` -> Recurring `Task` that repeats weekly (every 7 days)
4. `MONTHLY` -> Recurring `Task` that repeats every 4 weeks

If a user does not specify `Recurrence` when adding a new `Task`, it will default to a `NONE` `Recurrence` type.

#### Design considerations
##### Aspect: When should the task date be changed based on its `Recurrence` type

* Alternative 1: Once a user has marked a recurring `Task` as done, the date of the `Task` will be automatically changed to the next date according to its `Recurrence` type, with its completion status reset to be undone.
    * Pros: User Experience could be more intuitive in the sense that the user can focus on the next deadline rather than the current completed task
    * Cons: There is an increase in coupling between the `Task`â€™s `Status`, `Recurrence` and `DateTime` because `DateTime` now needs to depend on `Status` and `Recurrence` to decide if its date and time needs to be changed. This can increase bugs and make testing harder, as more functions would have side effects (resetting taskâ€™s completion `Status` and updating `Task`â€™s `DateTime`).

* Alternative 2: Once a `DateTime` of a `Task` has been passed, this will trigger nursey book to update the new `DateTime` of the `Task` according to its `Recurrence` type.
    * Pros: Easier to implement because there is only one condition that needs to be checked (if the `Task`â€™s `DateTime` is before the current `DateTime`) for the `Task`â€™s `DateTime` to be updated.
    * Cons: Restricted choice for users who would prefer seeing upcoming tasks to seeing completed tasks.

### Handling of Overdue and Recurring tasks

#### Implementation

The logic for handling overdue and recurring tasks are handled in `ModelManager#updateTasksAccordingToTime()`.

```     java
@Override
    public void updateTasksAccordingToTime() {
        versionedNurseyBook.updateRecurringTasksDate();
        versionedNurseyBook.updateTasksOverdueStatus();
        versionedNurseyBook.reorderTasksChronologically();
    }
```

The implementation of these individual functions `updateRecurringTasksDate()`, `updateTasksOverdueStatus()` and `reorderTasksChronologically()` are listed below.
1. `updateRecurringTasksDate()`
    *  This function checks whether a `Task` is overdue (`Task`'s `DateTime` is before the current `DateTime`) and if it is a recurring task (`Task#isRecurring` is `True`), before updating recurring tasks' DateTime as needed at the current time.
2. `updateNotOverdueTaskList()`
    *  This function first checks for either of 2 cases:
        * Whether it is overdue (`Status#isOverdue` is `True`) and should not be overdue
        * Whether it is not overdue and should be overdue
    *  Then updates overdue statuses accordingly
        * For first case, it marks the task as overdue
        * For second case, it marks the task as not overdue
3. `reorderTasksChronologically()`
    * This function sorts the tasks according to chronological order, whose order might be disrupted due to changes in `DateTime` of tasks due to `updateRecurringTasksDate()`.
    
Listed below are some situations and corresponding implementations where the overdue `Status`, and `DateTime` might be changed based on either a manual edit of the `Task`'s `DateTime` and/or `Recurrence` type, or simply the passing of time.

1. `DateTime` of non-recurring `Task` has passed current `DateTime`
  - Mark `Status#isOverdue` to `True`
2. `DateTime` of recurring `Task` has passed current `DateTime`
  - Update old `DateTime` to new `DateTime` according to its `Recurrence` type.
  - Mark `Status#isDone` to `False`
  - Status#isOverdue remains `False`
3. User edits non-recurring `Task` with a passed `DateTime` to a future `DateTime`
  - Mark `Status#isOverdue` to `False`
4. User edits non-recurring `Task` with a future `DateTime` to a passed `DateTime`
  - Mark `Status#isOverdue` to `True`

<img src="images/HandleOverdueAndRecurringTasksActivityDiagram.png" width="350"/>

For each `Task` in NurseyBook, it will go through this cycle of checks to ensure their `DateTime` and `Status` are updated accordingly.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo and redo features are facilitated by `VersionedNurseyBook`. It extends `NurseyBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as a `nurseyBookStateList` and `currentStateIndex`. 
The `VersionedNurseyBook` implements the following operations:

* `VersionedNurseyBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current nursey book state and the latest command result in its history.
* `VersionedNurseyBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous nursey book state from its history and returns the command result of the command undone.
* `VersionedNurseyBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone nursey book state from its history and returns the command result of the command redone.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitNurseyBook()`, `Model#undoNurseyBook()` and `Model#redoNurseyBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The data of the `VersionedNurseyBook` will be initialized with the initial nursey book. 
A new `NurseyBookState` will be created with a copy of the current nursey book and the `INITIAL_COMMAND_RESULT`. 
This initial nursey book state is added to the `nurseyBookStateList`, with the `currentStateIndex` pointing to that initial nursey book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `deleteElderly 5` command to delete the 5th elderly in the nursey book. The `deleteElderly` command calls `Model#commitNurseyBook()`, 
creating a new `NurseyBookState` with a copy of the modified state of the nursey book after the `deleteElderly 5` command executes and the command result of the `deleteElderly 5` command.
This nursey book state is then saved in the `nurseyBookStateList` and the `currentStateIndex` is shifted to the newly inserted nursey book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `addTag 1 t/diabetes` to add a tag to the first elderly in the list. The `addTag` command also calls `Model#commitNurseyBook()`, causing another modified nursey book state to be saved into the `nurseyBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitNurseyBook()`, so the nursey book state will not be saved into the `nurseyBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the tag to the elderly was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. 
The `undo` command will call `Model#undoNurseyBook()`, which will decrease the `currentStateIndex` by one, causing it to refer to the previous nursey book state, and restores the nursey book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStateIndex` is 0, referring to the initial nursey book state, then there are no previous states to restore. 
The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoNurseyBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempt to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoNurseyBook()`, which increases the `currentStateIndex` by one to refer to the previously undone state, and restores the nursey book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStateIndex` is equal to `nurseyBookStateList.size() - 1`, it is referring to the latest nursey book state, then there are no undone nursey book states to restore. 
The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoNurseyBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempt to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `viewElderly`. Commands that do not modify the data of the nursey book, such as `viewElderly`, will not call `Model#commitNurseyBook()`, `Model#undoNurseyBook()` or `Model#redoNurseyBook()`. 
Thus, the `nurseyBookStateList` and `currentStateIndex` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitNurseyBook()`. Since the `currentStateIndex` is not at the end of the `nurseyBookStateList`, all nursey book states after the `currentStateIndex` will be deleted. 
The new modified nursey book state is then saved into the `nurseyBookStateList`
Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `addTag 1 t/diabetes` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1:** Saves the entire nursey book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage as copies of the entire nursey book are saved.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `deleteElderly`, just save the elderly being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

**Decision:** Alternative 1 was chosen as there are many commands that change the data of the nursey book. 
With alternative 1, all these commands will go through the same activity of saving the nursey book state instead of having different activity flow for undoing or redoing each command, making it easier to maintain.

**Aspect: What to save:**
* **Alternative 1:** Save only the nursey book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: No information on the commands that changed the data of the nursey book.

* **Alternative 2:** Save the nursey book and the command result.
    * Pros: Information on the command that changed the data of the nursey book is saved.
    * Cons: More memory usage as more information needs to be saved and increases dependency between classes.

**Decision:** Alternative 2 was chosen as we feel that it is helpful to store information on the command that changed the data of the nursey book.
This way, when users execute the undo/redo command, information on the command that is being undone/redone is also available and can be shown to the user. 
The relevant user interface is also displayed to the user as the `ListDisplayChange` is in the command result saved. 
For example, when a user undoes an `addElderly` command, the user interface will toggle to the list of elderly based on the command result saved, showing the user the change.

### Delete Nok feature

#### Implementation

The implementation of `DeleteNokCommand` is highly similar to that of `DeleteCommand`. Major differences are in how the steps 5 and 6 below are handled.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete Nok mechanism behaves at each step. The example command is `deleteNok 1`.

Step 1. The user and executes `deleteNok 1` command to delete the NoK details of the first elderly in the elderly list. This prompts the `LogicManager` to start its execution by calling its `execute()` command.

Step 2. `LogicManager` calls the `NurseyBookParser` to parse the command.

Step 3. The `NurseyBookParser` creates a new `DeleteNokCommandParser` object and calls its `parse` method to parse the arguments. This creates and returns a new `DeleteNokCommand` which is ready to be executed, containing the index of the target elderly as one of its fields.

Step 4. The `DeleteNokCommand` is executed by calling its `execute()` method. This calls the `Model#getFilteredElderlyList()` and retrieves the filtered elderly list, which should contain all elderlies.

Step 5. A new updated Elderly object is created with all fields equivalent to the targeted Elderly object, apart from the Nok fields which are wiped. This process has been omitted from the sequence diagram below.

Step 6. The `Model#setElderly()` method is then called to replace the targeted Elderly with the updated Elderly object.

Step 7. A new `CommandResult` is returned which contains the details of the new Elderly object. The result is returned to `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find task operation works:

![DeleteNokSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteNokSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteNokCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

### Find task feature

#### Implementation

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(predicate)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find task mechanism behaves at each step. The example command is `findTask Pfizer`.

Step 1. The user launches the application and executes `findTask Pfizer` command to search for a list of tasks whose `Description` contains the keyword `Pfizer`. This prompts the `LogicManager` to start its execution by calling its `execute()` command.

Step 2. `LogicManager` calls the `NurseyBookParser` to parse the command.

Step 3. The `NurseyBookParser` creates a new `FindCommandParser` which will `parse()` the arguments. This creates a new `DescriptionContainsKeywordPredicate` that checks if a `Task`'s `Description` contains the keyword(s) - `Pfizer` in this case. A new `FindTaskCommand` which is ready to be executed is returned, containing the predicate as one of its fields.

Step 4. The `FindTaskCommand` is executed by calling its `execute()` method. This calls the `Model#updateFilteredTaskList()` and updates the filtered task list by checking the tasks with `DescriptionContainsKeywordPredicate`.

Step 5. A new `CommandResult` is returned which switches the display to the filtered task list. The result is returned to `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find task operation works:

![FindTaskSequenceDiagram](images/FindTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindTaskCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

### ViewElderly and ViewTasks feature

#### How `CommandResult` is changed

As nursey book has to support the display of two different lists (contacts vs task), each `CommandResult` object will now store the information which list should be displayed to the user.

The following class diagram shows the changes made to the `CommandResult` class. Each `CommandResult` has an enum that specifies the type of display.

* `CommandResult#ListDisplayChange.ELDERLY`â€‰â€”â€‰Specifies the elderly list to be displayed after the current command execution
* `CommandResult#ListDisplayChange.TASK`â€‰â€”â€‰Specifies the task list to be displayed after the current command execution
* `CommandResult#ListDisplayChange.NONE`â€‰â€”â€‰Specifies the type of displayed list should not change after the current command execution

![](./images/ViewElderlyClassDiagram.png)

#### How `MainWindow` processes `CommandResult`

`MainWindow#handleChange()` is a new method that handles the switching of the list display. It checks if a `CommandResult` object specifies the change of list display, and changes the UI accordingly.

#### Execution

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the display of elderly/task list mechanism behaves at each step. An example command is `viewElderly`, and the mechanism of `viewTasks` is similar.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The default display of nursey book shows the list of all elderly that were added in.

Step 2. The user runs a few other available commands, and wants to switch back to the default display with the elderly, thus executes the `viewElderly` command.

Step 3. `MainWindow#executeCommand("viewElderly")` is called. Within the method body, it calls the `LogicManager#execute()` which returns a new `CommandResult`.

Step 4. `MainWindow#executeCommand()` processes the `CommandResult`. It calls `MainWindow#handleChange()` to change the display of the list, to show all elderly.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens in the `MainWindow` class when the user enters either the `viewElderly` or `viewTasks` command.

![ViewElderlyActivityDiagram](./images/ViewElderlyActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to display elderlies and tasks separately**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using a commands `viewElderly` and `viewTasks`, switch the display in the main window between the elderly list and task list stored in `NurseyBook`.
  * Pros: Cleaner display, able to display the necessary information without cluttering the display window
  * Cons: The need to implement two new commands, `viewElderly` and `viewTask` for the user to view the two lists respectively. The code for the two commands might contain repetition due to the similarity in function.


* **Alternative 2:** Display the list of elderly and list of tasks side by side in the same display window.
  * Pros: Implementation/Creation of new commands are not needed. The user is able to type less yet still view what he/she is interested in.
  * Cons: With two different lists (that contain different objects) displayed side by side, the display might seem cluttered and hard to read from. It negatively impacts the user experience.

2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 elderlies and 1000 tasks without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  Data should be stored locally and without any DBMS.
5.  Should be for a single user, not multiple users.
6.  The system should respond within 2 seconds per search query.

### Glossary
